# MigraineList
This is the repo for my final project "Migraine Quiz" for the Grow with Google: Android Basics MOOC.
I suffer from migraines and often I wake up in the middle of a full-blown migraine. It is at these times that I need a little extra help because my brain doesn't work correctly and my reasoning skills are always weak and deranged. The one thing that can help me decide if I need to take a full round of migraine medicine is not functioning. If i rely on my faulty brain to tell me to take the stuff, I wind up sinking deeper into pain and confusion, many times the symptoms progress to the point where I am incapacitated, vomiting and blind. So, I made this handy app to guide me when I need an external tool to evaluate what my needs are.
MEDICAL DISCLAIMER
This app is for me only, it is a personal app developed for me and me alone. I have arrived at what works for me through years of trial and error. This is not to be used to evaluate a medical condition, I'm not a doctor or any kind of medical professional. 

I was going to develop a quiz about toads called “ToadAll Recall,” but then I had a migraine and was inspired.
